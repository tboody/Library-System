# Library-System
This Python program creates a basic library management system with two classes: Library manages book availability and lending, while Student handles borrowing and returning books.
The create_lib() function initializes the library, allows users to view available books, borrow, return, and displays borrowed books through a menu-driven interface. 
Users interact by selecting options to perform library actions, simulating a simplified library system with borrowing and returning functionalities.
